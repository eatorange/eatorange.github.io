## [Food Security Dynamics in the U.S., 2001-2017](files/AJAE MS#22016_manuscript_Jun 2023 Revision.pdf){target="_blank"}

With [Christopher B. Barrett](http://barrett.dyson.cornell.edu/){target="_blank"} and [John H. Hoddinott](https://www.human.cornell.edu/people/jfh246){target="_blank"} - *Conditionally Accepted* at *American Journal of Agricultural Economics*

***Abstract***: We study household food security dynamics in the United States from 2001 to 2017 using a new measure, the probability of food security (PFS), the estimated probability that a household’s food expenditures equal or exceed the minimum cost of a healthful diet. We use PFS to analyze household-level and subpopulation-scale dynamics by investigating the conditional distribution of estimated food insecurity spells and the chronic and transient components of estimated food insecurity. We find that two-thirds of households experienced no estimated food insecurity during the 2001-17 period and more than half of newly food insecure households regain food security within two years. Households headed by female, non-White, or less educated individuals disproportionately suffer persistent, chronic and/or severe food insecurity.

## [DOMESTIC OR IMPORTED? AN ANALYSIS OF RICE DEMAND IN SENEGAL](files/Senegal_rice.pdf){target="_blank"}

***Abstract***: Rice is among the most important cereals for African countries which absorb more than half of worldwide exports. West African countries depend particularly on rice imports in order to achieve food security. For this reason, many policy measures are implemented by governments to regulate the market and reduce the import dependency. This paper contributes to the rice policy debate by analyzing the demand side using the case study of Senegal in West Africa. We analyzed detailed data on rice consumption using a large primary survey of 6,328 rural and urban households in Senegal, with the QUAIDS model. Qualitative data were also collected and analyzed to better interpret results. We found that rural households consume far less local rice than their urban counterparts, meaning that location is a determinant of local rice consumption. We also show that types of rice consumed differ between rural and urban consumers. Urban households consume relatively more whole grain local rice while rural households consume more broken imported rice. Thus, to increase consumption of local rice, efforts should thus be made on the availability of broken local rice for both urban and rural consumers. Our results indicate no substitutability between domestic rice and imported rice in urban households and weak substitutability in rural households. In addition, results show that rice demand is price inelastic. Thus, price policies like subsidies or taxes may not be good shifters of domestic rice consumption.

## The Effects of the Food Stamp Program on Food Security Dynamics

***Abstract***: This study investigates the effects of the program on food security dynamics. The study uses state-level
SNAP Policy Index as an exogenous variation as an instrumental variable for program benefit redemption. Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data, the study observe the effects of the program participation on food security over the next 10 years, using the measures of chronic and transitory food security constructed from the Probability of Food Security (PFS), a new food insecurity measure that reflects the estimated probability that the household’s predicted food expenditures exceed the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) for its household composition, location and survey period (Lee et al. 2023).

<!-- ## [Social Norms and Human Capital Investment: Examining the Educational Impacts of Dowry in Rural India](files/Dowry_and_Education.pdf){target="_blank"} -->

<!-- ***Abstract***: This paper examines the consequences of sticky social norms for investments in human capital in the context of dowry payments and educational attainment. Using data from rural India the paper tests for educational impacts of a change in dowry payments brought about by the 1985 amendment to the Dowry Prohibition Act. The empirical strategy uses a Difference-in-differences design along with variation in exposure to the amendment by religion. Findings document a 18\% reduction in education as well dowry paid for exposed females post amendment. Households that experienced the most change in dowry payments exhibit the largest declines in years of education. Dowry and education are considered as signals communicating adherence to traditional norms to explain these results. Declines in educational attainment increase with increases in enforcement capacity, consistent with a backlash against challenged social norms. -->

## Estimating Multidimensional Development Resilience

With [Kibrom A. Abay](https://www.ifpri.org/profile/kibrom-abay){target="_blank"}, [Christopher B. Barrett](http://barrett.dyson.cornell.edu/){target="_blank"} and [John H. Hoddinott](https://www.human.cornell.edu/people/jfh246){target="_blank"}

***Abstract***: Resilience measurement has received substantial attention over the past decade or so. Existing measures, however, relate resilience to a single well-being indicator. This may be problematic in contexts where households face deprivations in multiple dimensions. We explore how sensitive estimates of household-level resilience are to the specific well-being indicator used and show that measures are only weakly correlated across different, reasonable indicators based on expenditure-based poverty, dietary diversity, and livestock asset holdings. We then introduce a multidimensional resilience measure, integrating the probabilistic moment-based resilience measurement approach with the multidimensional poverty measurement method. Applying the new method to household panel data, we show that univariate and multidimensional resilience measures can yield varied inferences on the development resilience impact of development interventions such as Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program.

## Poverty Dynamics in Peru - a Data-Driven Approach Using Synthetic Panel

With [Hongdi Zhao](http://barrett.dyson.cornell.edu/research/group/hongdi-zhao.html){target="_blank"}

***Abstract***: Understanding individual and household-level welfare dynamics is very important, and it can help economics and policymakers to study and design policies to help households trapped in long-term poverty. However, long-term household-level panel data to study the poverty dynamics are often unavailable. The synthetic panel method has been used recently to estimate poverty transition using cross-sectional data. Bounded estimates are generated where the true poverty transition is laying in between. Policymakers are more interested in poverty transition point estimates, while true point estimates are very sensitive to how cohorts (e.g. birth cohort, village, or district) are defined in the data. This paper suggests a data-driven way to define cohorts in estimating synthetic panel point estimates of poverty dynamics, using the Peru National Household Survey on Living Conditions and Poverty (ENAHO) from 2007 to 2019. In addition to point estimates using two years of data only, which is a common practice, the paper estimates long-term poverty dynamics for up to six years to test the robustness of the estimates in the long run.

<!-- ## [Gender differences in tertiary healthcare](files/Gender_healthcare.pdf){target="_blank"} -->

<!-- With [Tarun Jain](https://sites.google.com/virginia.edu/tarunjain/home?authuser=0){target="_blank"} and [Revathy Suryanarayana](https://revathy-suryanarayana.github.io/){target="_blank"} -->

<!-- ***Abstract***: We examine gender differences in access to and service within a publicly financed tertiary healthcare program in Andhra Pradesh India. We use claim-level administrative data from the program to estimate gender differences in access and services. We classify the distance the patient travels as access variables and the time for claim authorization, treatment, and discharge, as well as the amount approved and paid as service variables. We use a regression framework to control for the influence of other patient characteristics, the type of procedure, hospital, and quarter of treatment in making gender comparisons. -->

<!-- ## The Political Economy of Minimum Support Prices -->

<!-- With [Shilpa Aggarwal](https://aggarwalshilpa.wixsite.com/home) and [Ishani Chatterjee](https://economics.ucsd.edu/graduate-program/about/grad-profiles/cohort%202019/Chatterjee-ishani.html) -->

<!-- ***Abstract***:While the distortions from price controls are well-understood in theory, these may be underestimated if the controls are captured for uses beyond fixing market failures. We study this issue in the context of minimum support prices (MSP), the government of India's procurement price of food grains. We find that when a district with a historically larger area under cultivation for a crop is slated to go for elections, the central government announces a higher MSP for that crop. Since government procurement price is the same across the country, the center uses this blunt instrument only when other policy instruments are unavailable, i.e., when the incumbent state government is not aligned with the center. Even small increases in MSP can have large welfare effects as the central government spent nearly 1\% of the GDP on procurement in 2020-21. -->
