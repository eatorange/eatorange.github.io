## [Social Norms and Human Capital Investment: Examining the Educational Impacts of Dowry in Rural India](files/Dowry_and_Education.pdf){target="_blank"}

***Abstract***: This paper examines the consequences of sticky social norms for investments in human capital in the context of dowry payments and educational attainment. Using data from rural India the paper tests for educational impacts of a change in dowry payments brought about by the 1985 amendment to the Dowry Prohibition Act. The empirical strategy uses a Difference-in-differences design along with variation in exposure to the amendment by religion. Findings document a 18\% reduction in education as well dowry paid for exposed females post amendment. Households that experienced the most change in dowry payments exhibit the largest declines in years of education. Dowry and education are considered as signals communicating adherence to traditional norms to explain these results. Declines in educational attainment increase with increases in enforcement capacity, consistent with a backlash against challenged social norms.

## Alcohol Ban and Crime: The ABC's of the Bihar Prohibition. 

With [Kalyani Chaudhuri](https://economics.ucdavis.edu/people/kalyanic){target="_blank"}, [Revathy Suryanarayana](https://revathy-suryanarayana.github.io/){target="_blank"} and [Mrithyunjayan Nilayamgode](https://economics.virginia.edu/people/profile/mn4yk){target="_blank"}

***Abstract***: We study the relationship between alcohol consumption and crime using the implementation of a statewide total prohibition of alcohol in the Indian state of Bihar in 2016. Testing the theoretical argument that alcohol has differential effects on different kinds of crime, we use a difference-in-differences approach and find that the prohibition led to a 0.22 standard deviation reduction in the reported incidence of violent crimes, but had no significant impact on non-violent crimes. This effect is fairly persistent over time, lasting at least three years into the ban, indicating that it is a reliable medium-term strategy to control crime. Heterogeneity tests also reveal that the effect on crime is stronger in interior districts and districts with higher baseline alcohol consumption. We also observe stronger effects in districts where a smaller proportion of the population faces religious restrictions on alcohol consumption. Since all of these subgroups indicate districts where the ban is likely to have had a larger effect on alcohol availability and consumption, we conclude that the ban affects crime through this channel rather than that of institutional changes.


## Gender differences in tertiary healthcare.

With [Tarun Jain](https://sites.google.com/virginia.edu/tarunjain/home?authuser=0){target="_blank"} and [Revathy Suryanarayana](https://revathy-suryanarayana.github.io/){target="_blank"}

***Abstract***: We examine gender differences in access to and service within a publicly financed tertiary healthcare program in Andhra Pradesh India. We use claim-level administrative data from the program to estimate gender differences in access and services. We classify the distance the patient travels as access variables and the time for claim authorization, treatment, and discharge, as well as the amount approved and paid as service variables. We use a regression framework to control for the influence of other patient characteristics, the type of procedure, hospital, and quarter of treatment in making gender comparisons.

## The Political Economy of Minimum Support Prices

With Shilpa Aggarwal

operations. Formally we explore the interactions between support price, procurement and electoral capture by
the federal government through empirical analysis.
