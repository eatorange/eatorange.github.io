# Hello,
(2023-07) This page is currently under construction.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the field of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University. My interests are in food security, development economics, public policy and applied econometrics.
Before coming to Cornell, I received B.S. from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I worked as a research assistant at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) and Yale University, and as a consultant at Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) at the World Bank.
