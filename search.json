My area of interest include development economics, applied econometrics and public policy.\r\nBefore coming to Cornell, I received B.S. from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I worked as a research assistant at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) and Yale University, and as a consultant at Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) at the World Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Hoddinott - Conditionally Accepted at American Journal of Agricultural Economics\r\nAbstract: We study household food security dynamics in the United States from 2001 to 2017 using a new measure, the probability of food security (PFS), the estimated probability that a household’s food expenditures equal or exceed the minimum cost of a healthful diet. We use PFS to analyze household-level and subpopulation-scale dynamics by investigating the conditional distribution of estimated food insecurity spells and the chronic and transient components of estimated food insecurity. We find that two-thirds of households experienced no estimated food insecurity during the 2001-17 period and more than half of newly food insecure households regain food security within two years. Households headed by female, non-White, or less educated individuals disproportionately suffer persistent, chronic and/or severe food insecurity.\r\nWorking Papers\r\nDomestic or Imported? An Analysis of Rice Demand in Senegal\r\nWith Ndèye Fatou Faye, Amy Faye, Mouhamed Rassoul Sye and John McPeak\r\nAbstract: Rice is among the most important cereals for African countries which absorb more than half of worldwide exports. West African countries depend particularly on rice imports in order to achieve food security. For this reason, many policy measures are implemented by governments to regulate the market and reduce the import dependency. This paper contributes to the rice policy debate by analyzing the demand side using the case study of Senegal in West Africa. We analyzed detailed data on rice consumption using a large primary survey of 6,328 rural and urban households in Senegal, with the QUAIDS model. Qualitative data were also collected and analyzed to better interpret results. We found that rural households consume far less local rice than their urban counterparts, meaning that location is a determinant of local rice consumption. We also show that types of rice consumed differ between rural and urban consumers. Urban households consume relatively more whole grain local rice while rural households consume more broken imported rice. Thus, to increase consumption of local rice, efforts should thus be made on the availability of broken local rice for both urban and rural consumers. Our results indicate no substitutability between domestic rice and imported rice in urban households and weak substitutability in rural households. In addition, results show that rice demand is price inelastic. Thus, price policies like subsidies or taxes may not be good shifters of domestic rice consumption.\r\nWork in Progress\r\nPoverty Dynamics in Peru - a Data-Driven Approach Using Synthetic Panel\r\nWith Hongdi Zhao\r\n\r\nEstimating Multidimensional Development Resilience\r\nWith Kibrom A.
