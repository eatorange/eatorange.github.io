Using data from\nrural India the paper tests for educational impacts of a change in dowry payments brought\nabout by the 1985 amendment to the Dowry Prohibition Act. The empirical strategy uses\na Difference-in-differences design along with variation in exposure to the amendment by\nreligion. I document a decline in dowry exchanged as well as a 18% reduction in education\nfor exposed girls post amendment. I find that households that experienced the most\nchange in dowry payments exhibit largest declines in years of education. The evidence\nsuggests that changes in match quality, price effects and changes in bequest motives are\nunlikely to contribute to these results. Last, I explore gendered social norms as a potential\nmechanism.\nAlcohol Ban and Crime: The ABC’s of the Bihar Prohibition.\nWith Kalyani Chaudhuri, Revathy Suryanarayana and Mrithyunjayan Nilayamgode\nAbstract: We study the relationship between alcohol consumption and crime using the implementation of a statewide total prohibition of alcohol in the Indian state of Bihar in 2016. Testing the theoretical argument that alcohol has differential effects on different kinds of crime, we use a difference-in-differences approach and find that the prohibition led to a 0.22 standard deviation reduction in the reported incidence of violent crimes, but had no significant impact on non-violent crimes. This effect is fairly persistent over time, lasting at least three years into the ban, indicating that it is a reliable medium-term strategy to control crime. Heterogeneity tests also reveal that the effect on crime is stronger in interior districts and districts with higher baseline alcohol consumption. We also observe stronger effects in districts where a smaller proportion of the population faces religious restrictions on alcohol consumption. Since all of these subgroups indicate districts where the ban is likely to have had a larger effect on alcohol availability and consumption, we conclude that the ban affects crime through this channel rather than that of institutional changes.\nGender differences in tertiary healthcare.\nWith Tarun Jain and Revathy Suryanarayana\nAbstract: We examine gender differences in access to and service within a publicly financed tertiary healthcare program in Andhra Pradesh India. We use claim-level administrative data from the program to estimate gender differences in access and services. We classify the distance the patient travels as access variables and the time for claim authorization, treatment, and discharge, as well as the amount approved and paid as service variables. We use a regression framework to control for the influence of other patient characteristics, the type of procedure, hospital, and quarter of treatment in making gender comparisons.\nThe Political Economy of Minimum Support Prices\nWith Shilpa Aggarwal\nAbstract: We study the determination of minimum support prices within the institutional context of price support\noperations. Formally we explore the interactions between support price, procurement and electoral capture by\nthe federal government through empirical analysis.\n\n\n\n",
