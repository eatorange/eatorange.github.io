Hoddinott - Conditionally Accepted at American Journal of Agricultural Economics\r\nAbstract: We study household food security dynamics in the United States from 2001 to 2017 using a new measure, the probability of food security (PFS), the estimated probability that a household’s food expenditures equal or exceed the minimum cost of a healthful diet. We use PFS to analyze household-level and subpopulation-scale dynamics by investigating the conditional distribution of estimated food insecurity spells and the chronic and transient components of estimated food insecurity. We find that two-thirds of households experienced no estimated food insecurity during the 2001-17 period and more than half of newly food insecure households regain food security within two years. Households headed by female, non-White, or less educated individuals disproportionately suffer persistent, chronic and/or severe food\r\ninsecurity\r\nWorking Papers\r\nDOMESTIC OR IMPORTED? AN ANALYSIS OF RICE DEMAND IN SENEGAL\r\nWith Ndèye Fatou Faye, Amy Faye, Mouhamed Rassoul Sye and John McPeak\r\nAbstract: Rice is among the most important cereals for African countries which absorb more than half of worldwide exports. West African countries depend particularly on rice imports in order to achieve food security. For this reason, many policy measures are implemented by governments to regulate the market and reduce the import dependency. This paper contributes to the rice policy debate by analyzing the demand side using the case study of Senegal in West Africa. We analyzed detailed data on rice consumption using a large primary survey of 6,328 rural and urban households in Senegal, with the QUAIDS model. Qualitative data were also collected and analyzed to better interpret results. We found that rural households consume far less local rice than their urban counterparts, meaning that location is a determinant of local rice consumption. We also show that types of rice consumed differ between rural and urban consumers. Urban households consume relatively more whole grain local rice while rural households consume more broken imported rice. Thus, to increase consumption of local rice, efforts should thus be made on the availability of broken local rice for both urban and rural consumers. Our results indicate no substitutability between domestic rice and imported rice in urban households and weak substitutability in rural households. In addition, results show that rice demand is price inelastic. Thus, price policies like subsidies or taxes may not be good shifters of domestic rice consumption.\r\nWork in Progress\r\nThe Effects of the Food Stamp Program on Food Security Dynamics\r\nAbstract: This study investigates the effects of the program on food security dynamics. The study uses state-level\r\nSNAP Policy Index as an exogenous variation as an instrumental variable for program benefit redemption. Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data from 1978 to 2019, the study observe the effects of the program participation on food security over the next 10 years, using the measures of chronic and transitory food security constructed from the Probability of Food Security (PFS), a new food insecurity measure that reflects the estimated probability that the household’s predicted food expenditures exceed the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) for its household composition, location and survey period (Lee et al. 2023).\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimating Multidimensional Development Resilience\r\nWith Kibrom A. Abay, Christopher B. Barrett and John H. Hoddinott\r\nAbstract: Resilience measurement has received substantial attention over the past decade or so. Existing measures, however, relate resilience to a single well-being indicator. This may be problematic in contexts where households face deprivations in multiple dimensions. We explore how sensitive estimates of household-level resilience are to the specific well-being indicator used and show that measures are only weakly correlated across different, reasonable indicators based on expenditure-based poverty, dietary diversity, and livestock asset holdings. We then introduce a multidimensional resilience measure, integrating the probabilistic moment-based resilience measurement approach with the multidimensional poverty measurement method. Applying the new method to household panel data, we show that univariate and multidimensional resilience measures can yield varied inferences on the development resilience impact of development interventions such as Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program.\r\nPoverty Dynamics in Peru - a Data-Driven Approach Using Synthetic Panel\r\nWith Hongdi Zhao\r\nAbstract: Understanding individual and household-level welfare dynamics is very important, and it can help economics and policymakers to study and design policies to help households trapped in long-term poverty. However, long-term household-level panel data to study the poverty dynamics are often unavailable. The synthetic panel method has been used recently to estimate poverty transition using cross-sectional data. Bounded estimates are generated where the true poverty transition is laying in between. Policymakers are more interested in poverty transition point estimates, while true point estimates are very sensitive to how cohorts (e.g. birth cohort, village, or district) are defined in the data. This paper suggests a data-driven way to define cohorts in estimating synthetic panel point estimates of poverty dynamics, using the Peru National Household Survey on Living Conditions and Poverty (ENAHO) from 2007 to 2019. In addition to point estimates using two years of data only, which is a common practice, the paper estimates long-term poverty dynamics for up to six years to test the robustness of the estimates in the long run.\r\nEstimates of US Food Insecurity Dynamics: Measuring Food Insecurity Across the US with a New Synthetic Panel Approach\r\nWith Senan Hogan-Hennessy and Christopher B.
