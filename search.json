She is interested in studying the linkages between agriculture and nutrition and how these are likely to be impacted by climate shocks. Her research interests evolved from her experience as a research assistant in the Economics and Public Policy department at the Indian School of Business. As a researcher, she has worked on projects exploring the political economy behind the minimum support price of agricultural commodities in India and separately, on a project that enumerated farmer response to rainfall shocks and temperature variability. Natasha holds an M.A. in Economics from the Delhi School of Economics and an undergraduate degree in Economics from the University of Delhi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Testing the theoretical argument that alcohol has differential effects on different kinds of crime, we use a difference-in-differences approach and find that the prohibition led to a 0.22 standard deviation reduction in the reported incidence of violent crimes, but had no significant impact on non-violent crimes. This effect is fairly persistent over time, lasting at least three years into the ban, indicating that it is a reliable medium-term strategy to control crime. Heterogeneity tests also reveal that the effect on crime is stronger in interior districts and districts with higher baseline alcohol consumption. We also observe stronger effects in districts where a smaller proportion of the population faces religious restrictions on alcohol consumption. Since all of these subgroups indicate districts where the ban is likely to have had a larger effect on alcohol availability and consumption, we conclude that the ban affects crime through this channel rather than that of institutional changes.\r\nGender differences in tertiary healthcare.\r\nWith Tarun Jain and Natasha Jha\r\nAbstract: We examine gender differences in access to and service within a publicly financed tertiary healthcare program in Andhra Pradesh India. We use claim-level administrative data from the program to estimate gender differences in access and services. We classify the distance the patient travels as access variables and the time for claim authorization, treatment, and discharge, as well as the amount approved and paid as service variables. We use a regression framework to control for the influence of other patient characteristics, the type of procedure, hospital, and quarter of treatment in making gender comparisons.\r\nThe Political Economy of Minimum Support Prices\r\nWith Shilpa Aggarwal\r\nAbstract: We study the determination of minimum support prices within the institutional context of price support operations. Formally we explore the interactions between support price, procurement and electoral capture by the federal government through empirical analysis.\r\nImpact of Dowry on Human Capital Formation: Evidence from India\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
